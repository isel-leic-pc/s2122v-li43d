/**
 * Consider the Exchanger synchronizer performed in the first set of exercises. Make a synchronizer with similar

 * This synchronizer supports the exchange of information between pairs of coroutines. Coroutines that use it,
 * manifest their availability to initiate an exchange by invoking the exchange method, specifying the object they
 * want to deliver to the partner coroutine (value). The exchange method ends up returning the exchanged value,
 * when the exchange is performed with another coroutine.
